# EKiT Evaluation Icon Library

These icons can be used to evaluate a new engagment tool or program (e.g., a game, educational material, etc.).

Icons based on the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) to improve implementation effectiveness. The objective of CFIR is to understand and explain factors which influence implementation outcomes[1].

We provide access to a preview of the icons. For those interested in using the individual icon files please contact Casey Overby Taylor (cot [at] jhu.edu).
